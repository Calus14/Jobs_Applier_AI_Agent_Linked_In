TODO's

Caleb:
- Look into storing my resume in the AI models state so we can reduce the amount of tokens sent for each job evaluation
- Build in logic for only accepting jobs with a high enough chance to get a call back.
- Externalize the job evaluation process from main into its own factory
- Work into abstractly solving filling out of html for actual application sites (non-HMC specific solution)

Brian:
- Work on integration tests with the linkedin web_scrapper (probalby will need to make a dummy AIModel class)
- Work on setting linkedin preferences
- Work on documenting code with human readable explanations
